Easily create and record notes on any page.
Ever have a short idea that you want to jot down on a page? Want to work on short math or word problems without opening up a separate notepad? Temp Notes lets you do both those and much more.

Simply right-click anywhere on a page to bring up the context-menu and then choose the "Temp Note" entry. A small, draggable, box will pop up that you can record your notes in.
